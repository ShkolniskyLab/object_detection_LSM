# Object detection under the linear subspace model (LSM)
Matlab code accompanying the paper "Object detection under the linear subspace model"

The functions are written in MATLAB and do not use any external packages.

See .pdf for more details

# Getting started

Add folder to the MATLAB.
Run main.m
The code output figures stored at a directory named 'figs' under the same instaled path.
