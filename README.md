# Object Detection under the Linear Subspace Model (LSM)

This repository contains MATLAB code accompanying the paper titled "Object Detection under the Linear Subspace Model" (xxx put link).

The functions are implemented in MATLAB and do not require any external packages.


## Getting Started

1. Add the folder to your MATLAB directory.
2. Run `main.m`.

The code will generate figures stored in a directory named 'figs' within the same installed path.

## Running Time

- Running time on a Linux machine with 16 cores running at 2.1GHz, 768GB of memory, and an Nvidia Titan GPU, is approximately 35 minuets.
- Running time on MacBook Pro 14 with 8 cores running at 3.2GHz without the GPU is approximately 3 hours and 30 minuets.
